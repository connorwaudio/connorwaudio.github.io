<h1>Aurora</h1>

Aurora has sung the National Anthem all over the country for various marathons
and other sporting events. She went to high school for musical theater and
has been dancing ever since she was in diapers. She dances in pointe shoes, does
jazz, tap, ballet, and has even taken a few trips around a pole. She won
best actress at the New Show Festival in New York City in 2019. There's nothing
in this world she loves more than performing.
