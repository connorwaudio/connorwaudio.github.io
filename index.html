<p>Connor is a homo sapien from the planet earth. Connor likes to pluck strings which vibrate within magnetic fields to create electrical signals. These signals are then amplified and converted to pressure waves by a moving coil which vibrates a conical membrane. Connor also sometimes turns knobs which makes things sound better. Connor can only write about himself in the third person.</p>
